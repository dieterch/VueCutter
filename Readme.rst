Quart VueCutter
========
(c)2024 Dieter Chvatal

- This is a fullstack web-application with a backend in Python using the Quart framework, the backend is responsible for providing the frontend with the necessary data and for executing the cutting process. The cutting process is executed by an rq worker, which is started as a seperate process 'python worker.py'. the rq quue requires a redis server.
- The redis server is provided by a docker container (specifying 'redispw' in the docker-compose.yml file).
- The frontend consists of a vuetify-vue SPA. The compiled application is delivered by the Quart ASGI Webserver, so rest interface and frontend share one 'ip:port'. 
- A Plex Server in the local network is obviously required. python PlexAPI package is used to access the Plex Server.
