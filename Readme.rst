Quart VueCutter
========
\(c\) 2024 Dieter Chvatal

- This is a fullstack web-application with a backend in Python using the Quart framework, the backend is responsible for providing the frontend with the necessary data and for executing the cutting process. The cutting process is executed by an rq worker, which is started as a seperate process 'python worker.py'.  
- ffmpeg is required for picture extraction and movie cut.  
- The rq queue requires a redis server. In my case, the redis server is provided by a docker container (specified by a docker-compose.yml file).
- The frontend consists of a vuetify-vue SPA located in the subfolder vue-cutter. The compiled application is delivered by the Quart ASGI Webserver, so rest Interface and frontend share one 'ip:port'.
- A Plex Server in the local network is obviously required. python PlexAPI package is used to access the Plex Server. 

Installation
------------
To configure this application, you have to create a **config.toml** file in the same directory as this file with the following content:
:: 
  fileserver = 'xx.xx.xx.xx'
  plexurl = 'http://xx.xx.xx.xx:32400'
  plextoken = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  redispw = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
::
