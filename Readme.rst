Quart VueCutter
========
(c)2024 Dieter Chvatal

- This is a fullstack web-application with a backend in Python using the Quart framework, the backend is responsible for providing the frontend with the necessary data and for executing the cutting process. The cutting process is executed by an rq worker, which is started as a seperate process 'python worker.py'.
- ffmpeg is required for picture extraction, the movies themselves are cut by stunningly fast mcut (and its preprocessor reconstruct_apsc). I forked it from **opendreambox/enigma2-plugin-reconstructapsc** (originally part of VU+ ecosystem), modified to run on 32-bit arm architecture. A big *Thank you* to the original author Anders Holst (aho@sics.se), coded 2009-12-14 in C++  
- The rq queue requires a redis server. In my case, the redis server is provided by a docker container (specified by a docker-compose.yml file).
- The frontend consists of a vuetify-vue SPA located in the subfolder vue-cutter. The compiled application is delivered by the Quart ASGI Webserver, so rest Interface and frontend share one 'ip:port'.
- A Plex Server in the local network is obviously required. python PlexAPI package is used to access the Plex Server. 

Installation
------------
To configure this application, you have to create a **config.toml** file in the same directory as this file with the following content:
:: 
  fileserver = 'xx.xx.xx.xx'
  plexurl = 'http://xx.xx.xx.xx:32400'
  plextoken = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  redispw = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
::

Software:
:: 
  1.create and enter a folder on a raspberry pi 4+ or similar device.

  4.Install the frontend with the following commands:

 services:
   server:
     image: redis:6.2-alpine
     restart: always
     ports:
       - '6379:6379'                                                       
     command: redis-server --save 20 1 --loglevel warning --requirepass xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     volumes:
       - server:/data
 volumes:
   server:
     driver: local
